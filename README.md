## FMenu


</div>

### Description

Allows your user to create simple ~ complex pure API menus, with scripting and an unlimited amount of sub-levels.

This was actually created for a shell replacement project of mine, to allow simple and customizeable menu objects for my users.
 
### More Info
 
Entirely scripted from a custom INI file. (enclosed)

It's a touch messy with icon file names, as the full path is needed. I would have added in App.path or used the API SHGetPathFromIDList functions, but I wrote this all in VBA (at work.. I was bored.). Still, I could have used the above-mentioned API call, but I wanted to get this published. Besides, I'm lazy :p

Aside from your user specifying an incorrect execution command (when an item is clicked), none.
